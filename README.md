### Tasks for MonoGame Refresh (6 total)
1. - [x] Each star == random number of stars (~50-300).
2. - [x] Each star == different rotation. [^1]
3. - [x] Each star == different transparency.
4. - [x] Each star == different size/scale.
5. - [x] Each star == different colour.
6. - [x] Customize and personalize (custom draw statement for new background, changing stars to something cool).
7. - [ ] Refactor code 

Task completion: ```91.3/100%```

[^1]: ~~Sloppy~~ Fixed! Uses NextSingle method now. Short span between last and this commit (retraced steps with "Redo" button).

### Describe how I decided when it was appropriate to commit/push changes

In general, pushes are made when moderate changes have been made. example, a large addition (or other major changes) to the readme, especially where the readme references new features.

It feels nonsensical to push more frequently than once per task completed.

>The decisions were guided by some fair rules (paraphrased from original instructions):
> - several commits, good comments, meanful pushes.
> - absence of micro-changes (lots of pushes, minimal changes)
> - no copy-paste-push cycle
> - "evidence of an understanding of the process/flow of the commit/push cycle".

### Number of commits/pushes executed
12 commits, including completion of task 6.

### Any specific troubles encountered with GitHub or completing the assignment
- I had no issue cloning the repo to my local machine.
- Significant issues merging/rebasing local to personal rep (after cloning)
- followed instructed steps to download zip, then upload to empty repo. a pull was required to sync
- Busy last few weeks with other obligations caused delays and missed prescribed deadline.
- Took a bit of relearning the list function. I believe there are gaps.
- Code will absolutely benefit from a series of refactoring since my work.
- The MacOS version of the MGCB editor suddenly started working for the first time since setting up monogame on mac. No idea why, used as game background.

### AI Use Declaration
