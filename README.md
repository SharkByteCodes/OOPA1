### Describe how I decided when it was appropriate to commit/push changes

In general, pushes are made when moderate changes have been made. example, a large addition (or other major changes) to the readme, especially where the readme references new features.

It feels nonsensical to push more frequently than once per task completed.

>The decisions were guided by some fair rules (paraphrased from original instructions):
> - several commits, good comments, meanful pushes.
> - absence of micro-changes (lots of pushes, minimal changes)
> - no copy-paste-push cycle
> - "evidence of an understanding of the process/flow of the commit/push cycle".
